# Spam Filter

In this project, our objective is to create a function that filters spam messages with an accuracy of over 80%. In other words, we want our filter to accurately identify at least 80% of the messages entered.

For this project, we will use a dataset consisting of 5,572 SMS messages that have already been classified as either spam or non-spam. This dataset was compiled by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo. You can find more information about the dataset or download it [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection).
